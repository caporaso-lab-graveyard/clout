Automated Testing System Installation Guide
===========================================

#####################
Required Dependencies

The automated testing system requires:

- Python 2.7 (other version may also work, though this is the officially tested
and supported version)

- StarCluster (tested on 0.93.3)

############
System Setup
############

1) Edit your ssh config (typically in ~/.ssh/config) and add the following two
lines:

StrictHostKeyChecking no
ServerAliveInterval 120

The first line tells SSH not to ask us whether we want to connect or not to an
unknown host, which will ALWAYS occur since the Amazon EC2 instance will always
be a 'new' host each time one is created. This option allows us bypass this
prompt and keep the entire process automated.

The second line tells us to send keepalive packets to the Amazon EC2 instance
every two minutes so that our SSH connection doesn't drop during long-running
test suites.

2) Add the automated testing system's scripts and library areas to your PATH
and PYTHONPATH, respectively, changing the filepaths to point to wherever this
project resides. Feel free to add these lines to your .bashrc or .bash_profile
so that you won't have to execute them every time you open a new shell (make
sure to source your .bashrc or .bash_profile after you've added the lines):

export PATH=/home/some_user/automated_testing/scripts:$PATH
export PYTHONPATH=/home/some_user/automated_testing:$PYTHONPATH

3) Test that your install appears to be working by running the following
command:

run_test_suites.py -h

You should see the help text for the run_test_suites.py script printed to your
terminal.

You may want to add the run_test_suites.py script to a crontab to have the test
suites automatically run at some regular time interval. To do so, you'll need
to set the PYTHONPATH from within the crontab. For example:

    > crontab -e

Add this line to the crontab:

    PYTHONPATH=/path/to/automated/testing/system/directory

Please be sure to use absolute paths for all filepaths and commands.
